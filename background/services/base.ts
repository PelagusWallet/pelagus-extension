/**
 * `BaseService` provides a base class for {@link Service|services} that adhere
 * to a standard service lifecycle.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * The base service provides a handful of pre-handled details for these
 * services:
 *
 *  - A preconfigured `emitter` object for emitting events.
 *  - Built-in support for defining alarms and their handlers by name (more
 *    below).
 *  - A consistent, coherent implementation of `startService` and `stopService`.
 *    This includes only starting a service once, only stopping a service once,
 *    throwing if a caller attempts to restart a stopped service, and throwing if
 *    a caller attempts to stop an unstarted service.
 *  - Extension points for service start/stop processes at
 *    `internalStartService` and `internalStopService` (more below).
 *
 * ### Event types
 *
 * The type parameter to `BaseService` allows for the inclusion of a more
 * specific set of events relevant to the particular service. All services are
 * expected to emit service lifecycle events, and these are handled directly by
 * the `BaseService` class.
 *
 * ### Alarm scheduling
 *
 * The constructor for `BaseService` takes a set of {@link AlarmHandlerSchedule},
 * indexed by name in an object. When `startService` is called, those alarms
 * are added to the browser alarm list, and the `handleAlarm` method is bound
 * as a listener. It automatically invokes the associated handlers.
 *
 * ### Extending the start and stop processes
 *
 * The `startService` and `stopService` methods are not meant to be overridden
 * as they handle internal started/stopped state details. Instead,
 * `internalStartService` and `internalStopService` are both provided for
 * customization of the start and stop processes.
 *
 * By default, these two set up and tear down browser alarms, so subclasses
 * should generally call `BaseService`'s implementation.
