 *
 * When a network is passed to a name resolver function, the resolver MUST
 * return results for the same network that was passed.
 *
 * Name resolvers are checked in two phases, one which is used to statically
 * decide whether a resolver is _likely to be able to_ resolve a name, avatar,
 * or address, and one in which the resolution is attempted. The static phase is
 * used to avoid calls that are known to produce failures, such as attempting to
 * resolve a Bitcoin name on a resolver that only supports Ethereum.
